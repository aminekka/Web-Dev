        <p><em>Bell'Italia!</em> Italy has Europe's richest, craziest culture. After all, this nation is the cradle of European civilization — established by the Roman Empire and carried on by the Roman Catholic Church. <br><br>As you explore Italy, you'll stand face-to-face with some of the world's most iconic images from this 2,000-year history: <a href="https://romesite.com/colosseum.html"><strong>Rome's ancient Colosseum</strong></a> and playful <a href="https://romesite.com/trevi-fountain.html"><strong>Trevi Fountain</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187899-d195452-Reviews-Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa-Pisa_Province_of_Pisa_Tuscany.html"><strong>Pisa's Leaning Tower</strong></a>, Florence's Renaissance masterpieces (Michelangelo's David and Botticelli's Venus), and the island city of elegant decay — <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187870-Venice_Veneto-Vacations.html"><strong>Venice</strong></a>. Beyond these famous sights, though, Italy offers Europe's richest culture. Traditions still live within a country that is vibrant and fully modern. Go with an eye open to both the Italy of the past and of the present.<br><br></p>

            <p>Italy has one of Europe's longest histories, yet it's only been a country since 1861. In Roman times Italy was a single entity. It then divided into a collection of sovereign states and remained that way until 1861.</p>
            <li class="facts"><strong>Tourists throw €1,000,000 into the Trevi Fountain each year</strong></li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Fontana_di_Trevi_by_night.JPG/640px-Fontana_di_Trevi_by_night.JPG" width="200">
            <p>Toss a coin into the Trevi and you'll return to Rome. That's the legend.

Tourists toss around €3,000 a day into the fountain. This amounts to roughly €1,000,000 every year, which is all donated to charity.</p>
<li class="facts"> <strong>The Sistine Chapel welcomes over 20,000 visitors every day</strong></li>

<p>Michelangelo completed the Sistine ceiling in 1512 and today the Sistine Chapel is one of the world's most visited monuments.
