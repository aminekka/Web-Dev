    <p>Full many a glorious morning have I seen <br>
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br>
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br>
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<br>
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br>
With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br>
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br>
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:<br>
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,<br>
With all triumphant splendour on my brow;<br>
But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,<br>
The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now.<br>
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;<br>
Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.
